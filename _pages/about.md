My name is Ava (Zheer) Wang (王哲儿), I am a first year MSCSE student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to GT, I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Computer Science with high honors at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in May 2025. I will be joining Intuit as a Software Engineer Intern in summer 2026.
