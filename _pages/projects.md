# Acknowledgement
I had the privilege of getting into formal research early during my undergraduate degree, which gave me the opportunity to explore and understand what research truly is—and why we pursue it. I want to sincerely thank [Weijiang Li (Harvard)](https://vickyli99.github.io/), without her guidance and encouragement, I wouldn’t have even considered stepping into the world of research.

Speding three semesters in Champaign and one semester in Chicago allowed me to grow both academically and personally. I’m deeply grateful to [Prof. Koustuv Saha (UIUC)](https://koustuv.com/), [Prof. Eshwar Chandrasekharan (UIUC)](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com/), and [Prof. Haohan Wang (UIUC, NCSA)](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html) for their mentorship, trust, and collaboration. Their support helped shape my research direction and gave me the confidence to aim high. Also, I want to say thanks to my collaborators and friends—especially [Melissa Shi (UIUC)](https://melissashi2002.github.io/), [Agam Goyal (UIUC)](https://agoyal0512.github.io/), [Yilun Chen (UIUC)](https://achieved-mind-fe1.notion.site/Allen-Chen-s-Past-Contribution-bb44c951dead489fb5350cdf0735f770), and others who made the long hours and late nights worthwhile.

Later this summer, I’ll be joining Uber Freight as a Software Engineer II, focusing on algorithm, strategy and machine learning engineering for freight pricing. While I’m no longer a college student, I will stay engaged with research and continue learning and contributing.

This isn't the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning.
